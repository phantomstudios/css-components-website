CSS Components provides typing out of the box, but this page contains some further utilities and tips.

## Importing types

You can import all the types at once:

```tsx
import type * as CSSComponents from "@phntms/css-components";
```

These include:

- `CSSComponents.CSS` - The case type of css values, a string or array of css selectors.
- `CSSComponents.CSSComponentConfig` - The tyype for the config object passed to `styled`.
- `CSSComponents.VariantProps` - A utility for extracting variant props from a component.

## Extract variants from a component

You can use the `VariantProps` utility to extract variants from a component. This ensures your variants support responsive syntax.

```tsx
import { styled, VariantProps } from "@phntms/css-components";

const Button = styled("button", {
  css: "button",
  variants: {
    size: {
      1: "buttonSize1",
      2: "buttonSize2",
    },
  },
});

type ButtonVariants = VariantProps<typeof Button>;
type SizeValues = ButtonVariants["size"];
```
