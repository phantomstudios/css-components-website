Below is a full example of a basic component put together using CSS Components.

Here you can see the `Panel` component in action. It's a simple component that has a title and some content.

<Preview>
  <Panel title="Hello World" wide>
    <p>This is some example content. It's not very exciting.</p>
  </Panel>
</Preview>

```tsx
import Panel from "@/components/Panel";

() => (
  <Panel title="Hello World" wide>
    <p>This is some example content. It's not very exciting.</p>
  </Panel>
);
```

## panel/index.tsx

This is the main component file. It's a simple component that has a title and some content. `PanelWrapper`, `Title` and `Content` are all CSS Components that are imported from `styles.tsx`.

```tsx
import { PanelWrapper, Title, Content } from "./styles";

interface Props {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  wide?: boolean;
}

const Panel = ({ title, children, wide }: Props) => (
  <PanelWrapper wide={wide}>
    <Title>{title}</Title>
    <Content>{children}</Content>
  </PanelWrapper>
);

export default Panel;
```

## panel/styles.tsx

This is the styles file. It contains the CSS Components that are used in the main component file. As you can see, CSS Components are simply a way to map CSS classes to React component in a logical way, nothing more.

```tsx
import { styled } from "@phntms/css-components";

import css from "./styles.module.css";

export const PanelWrapper = styled("div", {
  css: css.PanelWrapper,
  variants: {
    wide: {
      true: css.PanelWrapper_wide,
    },
  },
});

export const Title = styled("h2", {
  css: css.Title,
});

export const Content = styled("section", {
  css: css.Content,
});
```

## panel/styles.module.css

Lastly, this is the bog standard CSS file. It contains the CSS classes that are used in the CSS Components.

```css
.PanelWrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  text-align: center;
  margin: auto;
  width: 240px;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: #e6e6e6;
  color: black;
}

.PanelWrapper_wide {
  width: 100%;
}

h2.Title {
  background-color: #d6d6d6;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 1rem;
}

section.Content {
  padding: 1rem;
}
```
