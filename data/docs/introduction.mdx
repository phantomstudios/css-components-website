description: The what and the why of CSS Components.

CSS Components is a lightweight, performant styling library with a focus on component architecture and developer experience.

At Phantom we are huge fans of CSS-in-JS. We use it for all of our projects, and we love the flexibility and power it gives us. However, we have found that it can be challenging to use with the latest innovations with React, specifically [Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components) and Next.js 13. The current alternative is to use other more traditional CSS styling techniques. We have found the developer experience to be lacking, and even simple components littered with ugly computed `classNames`.

This library is heavily inspired by [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/), and is for the mostpart, a direct port of the core functionality. CSS Components is not a whole styling system or library. It is a simple utility to wrap your CSS into React components, and provide a simple and farmiliar API for using them.

## Highlights

### Farmiliar Experience

If you have used [Stiches](https://stitches.dev/) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) you will feel at home.

The concept of variants are exactly the same. CSS Components essentially modernises the traditional CSS authoring pipeline and provies a great developer experience.

### Server Components

Many UI libraries do not support [Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components) and more traditional CSS techniques are needed.

CSS Components woorks flawlessly with Server Components and works alogside your traditional CSS system (e.g. CSS Modules).

## Key Features

### Variants

Cribbed from Stitches, [variants](/docs/variants) is a first-class citizen, so you can design composable component APIs.

You can define a single variant, multiple variants, and even [compound variants](/docs/variants#compound-variants) which allow you to define styles based on a combination of variants.

Variants can be applied conditionally or responsively.

### CLI Tools

[CLI Tools](/docs/cli) Allows you to run a simple command to scan your codebase for css files and automagically generate the corresponding React components.

```bash
npx css-components --css ./src/**/*.css --output styles.ts
```

### Overrides

CSS Components internally rides on the `className` prop but respects any classNames you pass in.

```jsx
<Button style={{ backgroundColor: "red" }}>Button</Button>
```

You can also pass in a className and CSS component will pass it through along with its internal styles.

```jsx
<Text className="massive">Heading</Text>
```

### Developer Experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Stitches provides a fully-typed API, so when using TypeScript, CSS properties, values, and breakpoints will be auto-completed for you.
