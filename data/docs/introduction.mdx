description: The what and the why of CSS Components.
---

Phantom is a firm believer in the versatility and power of CSS-in-JS, using it for all its projects. However, with the advancements in React like [Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components) and Next.js 13, using CSS-in-JS can become a challenge. The conventional CSS styling options fail to offer a seamless developer experience and result in cluttered code.

CSS Components was created to solve these problems by offering a React component library that prioritizes component architecture and developer experience. Inspired by [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/), it brings the core functionality to React components, making it easier to wrap CSS styles in React and streamline the use of CSS styles. CSS Components is not a complete styling system, but rather a convenient tool that enhances the developer experience.

CSS Components stands out with its simplicity, providing a straightforward way to use standard CSS styles as reactive React components. The CLI automatically builds components from CSS files following a specific naming convention, making the use of CSS styles more efficient in React.

At Phantom, CSS Components has been successfully used in multiple projects with positive results. It offers a clean solution that has had zero developmental issues.

CSS Components offers a fresh take on using CSS styles in React, different from other CSS-in-JS solutions. Its approach is innovative, yet familiar in terms of developer experience. It provides a clean and efficient way to incorporate CSS styles into React projects.

## Highlights

### Familiar Experience

If you have used [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) you will feel at home.

The concept of variants are exactly the same. CSS Components essentially modernises the traditional CSS authoring pipeline and provides a great developer experience.

### Server Components

Many UI libraries do not support [Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components) and more traditional CSS techniques are needed.

CSS Components works flawlessly with Server Components and works alongside your traditional CSS system (e.g. CSS Modules).

## Key Features

### Variants

Cribbed from Stitches, [variants](/docs/variants) is a first-class citizen, so you can design composable component APIs.

You can define a single variant, multiple variants, and even [compound variants](/docs/variants#compound-variants) which allow you to define styles based on a combination of variants.

Variants can be applied conditionally or responsively.

### CLI Tools

[CLI Tools](/docs/cli) Allows you to run a simple command to scan your codebase for css files and automagically generate the corresponding React components.

```bash
npx css-components --css ./src/**/*.css --output styles.ts
```

### Overrides

CSS Components internally rides on the `className` prop but respects any classNames you pass in.

```jsx
<Button style={{ backgroundColor: "red" }}>Button</Button>
```

You can also pass in a className and CSS component will pass it through along with its internal styles.

```jsx
<Text className="massive">Heading</Text>
```

### Developer Experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. CSS Components provides a fully-typed API, so when using TypeScript, CSS properties, values, and breakpoints will be auto-completed for you.
