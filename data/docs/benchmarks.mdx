## The tests

We've put together a test suite to test a range of perfomance factors across multiple CSS-in-JS libraries and CSS Components.

All tests use object notation. All tests were run in a production environment, on a machine with the following spec:

- Macbook Pro 2022
- Apple M1 Max
- 32GB LPDDR5

Just like CSS Components, our [benchmark tests](https://github.com/phntms/css-components-bench) are also open-source.

### Initial injection

The timing that it takes apply the initial styles. This happens when a component is rendered.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: "CSS Components", value: 0.0042 },
    { name: "Emotion", value: 0.0709 },
    { name: "Stitches", value: 0.0771 },
    { name: "styled-components", value: 0.1015 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Updating variants

Changing the variants is now faster than ever. Since we are just witching classNames.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: "CSS Components", value: 0.0047 },
    { name: "Stitches", value: 0.0148 },
    { name: "Emotion", value: 0.029 },
    { name: "styled-components", value: 0.0361 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: Since styled-components and Emotion don't offer a first-class variant API, this was done via prop interpolation.

### Updating `style` or `css` prop

The `style` or `css` is the best way to handle dynamic styles. This needs to happen fast - and it does!

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: "CSS Components", value: 0.0065 },
    { name: "Stitches", value: 0.015 },
    { name: "Emotion", value: 0.0666 },
    { name: "styled-components", value: 0.1333 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: Since css-components don't offer a first-class `css` prop, we are comparing against standard the `style` prop.

### Mounting deep tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many nested nodes.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: "CSS Components", value: 1.7666 },
    { name: "Stitches", value: 2.1333 },
    { name: "Emotion", value: 3.6333 },
    { name: "styled-components", value: 4.0193 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks). Emotion also tests against this.

### Mount wide tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many sibling nodes.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: "CSS Components", value: 3.08 },
    { name: "Stitches", value: 3.6366 },
    { name: "styled-components", value: 5.898 },
    { name: "Emotion", value: 6.036 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks). Emotion also tests against this.

## Summary

Our benchmarks compare against Stitches, styled-components and Emotion because they're the most popular CSS-in-JS libraries, and they've pushed us to improve our performance. Our goal with these benchmarks is to provide transparent performance comparisons for the community.

If you'd like us to include your CSS-in-JS library, or think the tests could be improved, please [open an issue](https://github.com/phntms/css-components-bench).
